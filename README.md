I am a passionate web developer with a keen interest in creating innovative and visually appealing websites. My journey in web development began during my college years, and since then, I have honed my skills in front-end and back-end development. I thrive on challenges and enjoy crafting seamless online experiences that leave a positive impact on users.

## Education

I pursued my undergraduate studies in **Data Science** at the **University of Science & Technology Bannu**, where I gained a solid foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and data structures. I actively participated in coding competitions and various tech events, which sharpened my problem-solving skills. Elective courses in web development and UX design sparked my interest in building elegant and intuitive websites.

## Skills

As a web developer, I possess a versatile skill set. On the front-end, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating responsive and mobile-friendly interfaces. I am well-versed in front-end libraries like React and Angular for dynamic web applications. On the back-end, I have expertise in Node.js and Python, along with a sound understanding of databases and server-side technologies. I also prioritize strong communication and problem-solving abilities.

## Hobby

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid photographer. Capturing moments through the lens allows me to see the world from different perspectives and influences my design aesthetics as a web developer. Photography serves as a perfect complement to my technical endeavors, providing a balanced outlet for self-expression.
